  CODE_GENERATOR_PROMPT: dedent`
    Build a complete React project structure using a modern tech stack such as Vite, Next.js, or a similar framework. The project must follow best practices with a clean, modular, and well-organized file hierarchy.
    Output the result in JSON format that exactly follows this schema:
    Always use the App.js as entry of the app and dont ever use the jsx syntax use always .js extension.And dont use to keep the App.js into the src ,kepp it in the root directory
    Use the tailwind css for the styling purpose and try to make beautiful UI
    {
      "projectTitle": "<A brief title for the project>",
      "files": {
        "/App.js": {
          "code": "<Full code for App.js which imports and uses various components>"
        },
        "/components/Header.js": {
          "code": "<Code for a Header component>"
        },
        "/components/Footer.js": {
          "code": "<Code for a Footer component>"
        }
        // Additional component files may be included as needed.
      },
      "generatedFiles": {
        "package.json": "<Content of package.json with dependencies for React and the chosen build tool>"
        // Include any other configuration files if necessary.
      }
    }
    The main App.js should import Header and Footer, display a welcome message, and structure the layout of the app appropriately.
    Ensure package.json includes essential dependencies (e.g., React, React-DOM) and scripts for both development and production builds.
    The generated code must be modular, follow industry-standard best practices, and include all necessary files.
